# professional_portfolio

## Description 

The Professional portfolio showcases my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. The portfolio highlights my most substantial work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. Several deployed projects are a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
